# compiler-implementation-python
This is an implementation of a compiler for a small language made in my University of Ioannina. 

Execution steps
1. Write a program in the CPY programming language as defined in the documentation given.
2. Run the compiler program using the python interpreter (e.g python3 test_program.cpy)

   --------------NOTE---------------
The output of the compiler program will be:
  1. A file containing the intermediate code.
  2. A file containing the symbol table.
  3. A file containing the final (assembly) code in RISC-V.
